    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
        Chole Bhature is a beloved North Indian dish featuring Chole (spiced chickpea curry) and Bhature (deep-fried
        bread). The chickpea curry is cooked in a flavorful tomato-based gravy with spices like cumin, coriander, and
        garam masala. It's garnished with cilantro, onions, and lemon juice. The Bhature, made from a dough of
        all-purpose flour and yogurt, is deep-fried to a crispy golden perfection. This dish is a popular street food
        and home-cooked meal, often served with pickles, onions, and yogurt to balance the flavors. Chole Bhature offers
        a delightful combination of spicy, tangy chickpeas and soft, fluffy, deep-fried bread, making it a cherished
        part of Indian cuisine.
