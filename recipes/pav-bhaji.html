    <h2>Description: </h2>

    <p>
        Pav Bhaji is a fast food dish from Mumbai (Bombay), India, consisting of a vegetable curry (bhaji) cooked in
        tomato gravy and served with a soft bread roll (pav). While Bhaji is a traditional Indian name for a vegetable
        dish, the Pav or Pao was the Portuguese word for bread, which was introduced by them during their brief presence
        in Mumbai around the mid-1500s.
